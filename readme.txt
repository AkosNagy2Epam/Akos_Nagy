Hometask 8:

The solution for the hometask is in the WebAPITest folder.
There are 2 projects present in the solution:
	WebAPITest: This one contains everything the tests need to work.

	Tests: 	This project contains the tests.(4 positive and 4 negative)
		The tests are in BDD style created using SpecFlow.

		After the tests are run, the generated test report can be found in the
		WebAPITest\Tests\bin\Debug\netcoreapp3.1\TestReport\
		folder. The report is generated using Extent.
	
The postman folder contains the exported postman collection which has 8 requests that correspond to the 8 tests.
