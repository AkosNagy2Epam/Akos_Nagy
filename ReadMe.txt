You can find HomeTask5 in the Akos_Nagy_HomeTask5 folder.
This hometask consists of 5 tasks.
I tried to keep a clean and simple structure for the code:
    There are 2 projects:
        -The HomeTask5 project contains all the Tasks.
            All five tasks are in the Tasks.cs file.
        -The HomeTask5Tests project contains all the tests for these tasks. 
            There are tests for one task per file. So all the tests are in 5 files altogether.
